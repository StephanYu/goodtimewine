Notes:

personal concierge service via data-driven human/artificial intelligence hybrid or pure AI play

building a human-focused, relationship-driven personalization platform actually provides for a tangible differentiator against other more established physical goods e-tailers — one of the few ways to build defensibility in a commerce segment traditionally dependent on “brand” as its only de facto moat.

Etailers like Amazon are predominantly a destination for directed search – either on a specific product or specific category basis. But as purchasing increasingly shifts to mobile, it turns out that it continues to be difficult to search, discover and catalogue individual items. Concierges – especially when leveraged via a mobile interaction point – reduce that friction and enable a new purchasing behavior.

But based on the hyper-growth of concierge-facilitated platforms, it appears that curation doesn’t go far enough for the emerging set of millennial buyers — they demand even more assistance and personalization than before.

The middlemen — when incentivized via a pay-for-performance model — actually become de facto customer acquisition agents for the company, serving as outbound salespeople. Trunk Club was one of the innovators of this model and our portfolio company, LGS, has leveraged it with great success.

it is still unclear if hybrid AI assistants can provide an end-user experience powerful enough to materially affect purchasing, conversion and frequency.

For the time being, within the fully human-powered services, the winning business models will be ones that can hire relatively inexpensive, untrained people who can then be empowered via software or leveraged workflows to deliver a meaningfully improved end-user experience.

Startups trying to wedge into the market using a high level of service need to be highly cognizant of, and focused on, controlling costs. Especially as the investor market continues transitioning away from high cash burn models, obsessive attention on how to deliver a high-quality experience, deepening long-term scalability and leveraging lower-cost labor will yield many compelling outcomes.
